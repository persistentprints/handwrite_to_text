the sake of the project is to create a handwritte to text app, using a CCN for the recognition part made with tensorflow-keras library, the dataset used is the NIST Special Database 19, the link is this:

https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19

File description:

full_integration.py.- It's the main application it inculdes the gui and the processing part to get the prediction of the characters written.

main.kv.- The code for the gui.

ocr_cnn_v1.py.- Code for training the CNN

models(folder).- Contains diferent CNN models the the most importants are 'char_ocr_model_128_v1.h5'(default), 'char_ocr_model_64_v2.h5' and 'mnist_model.h5'.

dataset_processor.py.- It is used for reading and processing the NIST-dataset dividing it in a test set and train set.

dataset_processor_only_char.py.- The same as dataset_processor but it only takes lowercase letters.

gui.py.- A code used to program and test the gui part.

image_process.py.- The implementation of the characters detection using opencv.

test_cnn.py.- test a CNN model using with an image.

8-bit.ttf.- 8 bit style font used in the gui part.
